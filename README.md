# DailyCode ðŸ’»
This repo is for solutions of algorithmic problems from HackerRank. I'll post ( try to ) at least one solution per day.

#### NOTE  
DailyCode and Django-Curated-Resources are the resource modules that would be available in DomeCode, a project created by me to help new coders learn from resources compiled from all over the internet, solve problems in our Remote Code Execution Environment in languages including Python, Java and, C++ initially.

### LANGUAGE USED :
* Python3

If I'm feeling adventurous on a particular day, I might do the problem in C#, Ruby, Rust or even php but since hard problems on HackerRank only have C++, Java and Python as the options I'll stick to the latter two.

### UPDATE(s) â†“  

#### APRIL 

- Apart from updating 30 days to Code until Day 20 today ( April 21 2020 ) and adding three new solutions to INOI problems from CodeChef, I'm adding the `PHP` solutions to the basic challenges as well just for fun.

- Started with practicing for INOI using CodeChef. One INOI problem each day cause I'm working simultaneously on my "DomeCode-Learn to Code" website, practicing on Hackerrank's Python Skill and, still getting better at Django and getting better at it. 

- Completed Virtusa Tech Interview Preparation Questions. Will update the repository at once when I complete the 30 Days of Code Challenge.

- I got the Google Foobar invite again so I'm including the Foobar solutions as well. I'm not a really good competitive programmer or anything, I just try and look up references carefully and accurately which has a downside of me taking longer to solve problems with more difficult concepts than those I've already worked on. For the difficult Foobar problems using a lot of Math, I'm trying to find the relevant implementations and studying more on the theory of Algorithms like Floyd's algorithm that would be useful in solving problems.

- I'm also including all the solutions to the Hackerrank 30 Days Code Challenge and will try to make explanation videos for each of them in the future along with the Interview Preparation Kit Solutions.

#### FUN FACT
FACEBOOK was made without a php framework from scratch and eventually they made their framework probably and a compiler ( for sure ) called HipHop which converted php code to c++ code first.
